**Descent Literacy Extent** is an [Epithets/Anime Campaign](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FDjPzvwzjypF0LUFjHpHELCMycIL7NA2g5BFPlEdYTo/edit#) game that has been turned into an interactive [Twine](https://twinery.org/) with the [SugarCube v2](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/) library. The story, as well as all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this production, are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased), places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred.

In short, this work is a nonprofit piece for entertainment and little else. Credits can be found on the respective credits page.
